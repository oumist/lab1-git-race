## How to build the code

This App's code is built using [Gradle](http://gradle.org), for its installation please refer to the [Gradle installation guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html). To then build the code follow the following steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/lab1-git-race
cd lab1-git-race
./gradlew build
```

After the build is completed, the generated WAR file will be located inside the _libs_ folder under the _build_ directory.

## How to test the code

Gradle can perform all tests automatically.

```bash
./gradlew check
```

## How to run the code

This program runs an application server (embedded into Spring library).
In order to build and execute the project you have to do:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

## How to deploy the code in a server (using Heroku)

### Web's deployment using Heroku and GitHub

- Install Git Bash and Heroku CLI locally
- Log in Git and Heroku
- Create a new app in Heroku's web with the desired name (deployp1iw)
- Add dependencies in build.gradle
- Create a Procfile file that executes app's .war
- While on app's root directory (locally), create a link between GitHub and Heroku: heroku git:remote -a deployp1iw
- Push to Heroku: git push heroku master

Once the previous steps have been followed, the web is deployed, the following link shows the web (it may take time to load the web due to Heroku's restrictions on free apps): <https://deployp1iw.herokuapp.com/>
These guides have been followed to deploy the web: <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git> (deploy using Git) and <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-gradle-apps-on-heroku> (deploy using Gradle).

This web has been documented using Swagger, which allows you to describe the generated API (Controllers) and its functions. The next guide has been followed to document the web: <https://www.baeldung.com/swagger-2-documentation-for-spring-rest-api>
A new class has been added to the application, SpringSwaggerConf.java, which defines Swagger's configuration. The class HelloController.java has been modified, adding the API's description and its only function's description (welcome).
Swagger documentation: <https://deployp1iw.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui/#/>

## How to deploy the code in a server (using AWS)

Web's deployment using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, CodeCommit, CodeBuild and CodePipeline.

### PREREQUISITES

- Python 2.7, 3.4 or any later version.
- Any version of the package manager **pip** (for Windows and Linux users. MacOS users will use Homebrew)
- An account of any type in <https://aws.amazon.com/>

Linux Guide: <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install-linux.html>
Windows Guide: <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install-windows.html>

### STEPS

#### Account Setup

1. Having installed all the prerequisites, install the **AWS EB CLI**, using the **pip** command (Windows and Linux) or the **brew** command (MacOS)
2. Make sure the python scripts folder is in the **PATH user environment variable**, as explained in the following tutorial:
   <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install-advanced.html> (Windows and Linux)
   <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install-osx.html> (MacOS).
3. Login to our AWS account and access the Identity and Access Management (**IAM**) console: <https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/home>
4. Select the **Users** tab on the left and then **Add user(s)**
5. Give the new user any name and select (AT LEAST) **programmatic access** in the access options.
6. In the permissions tab, assign the policies **AWSCodeCommitFullAccess**, **AWSElasticBeanstalkFullAccess**, **AWSCodeBuildAdminAccess** and **AWSCodePipeline_FullAccess** to the user (or include the user in a group with such policies assigned to it).
7. We will not be adding tags at the moment, so we can skip to the end of the creation process.
8. When the site tells us the creation was correct, it will show us the name of the user along with its **ID access and secret keys**. We must keep them for later.
9. Click the **Close** button on the lower part of the site to go back to the IAM console, and then click on the user which was just created.
10. Navigate to the **Security Credentials** tab and generate **Git HTTPS for AWS CodeCommit credentials** and save them for later.

#### Elastic Beanstalk setup

1. With any command terminal, we must browse to the repository and execute the command `eb init` to initiate the process to create the application and setting up the environment.
2. First, we will introduce the region that's closest to us (in my case, `17`, which is located in Paris)
3. If the terminal prompts us for credentials, we must introduce the _ID access_ and _secret keys_, which you must have obtained in step 8.
4. Give the application a name (in my case lab1-git-race-app).
5. Select **TomCat** as the platform.
6. Select the latest version of the platform branches (in our case, `Tomcat 8.5 with Corretto 11 running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2` will be enough, since it's compatible with **Java 11**).
7. Continue with CodeCommit and select the repository and branch you want to use.
8. If the terminal prompts us for credentials, we must introduce the user and password which we obtained in step 10.
9. Since we do not want to connect to the page using SSH, I have not set up SSH (the terminal asks us if we want to).

#### Environment creation

1. Execute the command `eb create` and type the name, DNS CNAME, load balancer and Spot Fleet as you want the app to run. (in my case: **lab1-git-race-app-env**, **lab1-git-race-app-env**, **application**, no. This means the traffic will be redirected in the application level, and the Spot Fleet service from Amazon won't be used).
1. Re-enter the Git HTTPS credentials.
1. Go to the AWS Elastic Beanstalk console and navigate to **Environments**.
   <https://eu-west-3.console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home?region=eu-west-3#/environments>
1. Select the environment we just created and go to **Settings** on the left part of the site
1. Edit the **Software** section in the settings and add the environment variable **SERVER_PORT** and set it to the value **5000**.
   This is so the environment knows which port the server is using (currently 5000).

### Build Automatization

1. Go to the CodeCommit console and to the repository we just created. <https://eu-west-3.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codecommit/repositories?region=eu-west-3>
1. Navigate to **CodeBuild** and create a new compilation process.
1. Fill in the data:
   - Give it a name.
   - Select `AWS CodeCommit` as the provider, and then select our repository and the branch we are commiting to.
   - Choose any option for the environment (in my case, `administrated image` and `Amazon Linux 2`)
   - Make sure the default option (compilation specification file) is chosen. This will use the `buildspec.yaml` file that indicates CodeBuild **how to build the code and what are the outputs**.
   - On the Artifacts part, we must add an Amazon S3, and the name of an elasticbeanstalk bucket should appear. We choose that one and proceed to set the name empty (it will be filled automatically) and set the route to `build/libs` (which is the file gradle builds).
     And most importantly, we must select **Zip** as the packaging, so Elastic Beanstalk can read it afterwards.
   - We can skip to the last part and create the project.
1. Once we have that done, we navigate to the **Compilation details** part and click on the **Service Role**. We select the policy `CodeBuildBasePolicy-Gradle_compilation-eu-west-3` and edit it:
   - On S3, we select **All resources** on the resources menu.
   - On CloudWatch Logs, we do the same.
   - Uncheck the "Set as predetermined" option
   - Save the changes
1. Now navigate to **CodePipeline** and create a new pipeline. Give it a name and configure the source to be our AWS CodeCommit repository and branch. (using Amazon CloudWatch Events so it triggers a deployment everytime we make any changes). The compilation phase should be set to our AWS CodeBuild project and finally, we can set the implementation phase to our AWS Elastic Beanstalk to our EB application and environment.
1. Go back to the environment overview in Elastic Beanstalk (click the name of the environment on the left navigation bar) and wait until the status is showing a **big green tick**. Then, you can get the URL right below the name.

After all these steps, the app should be up and running.

In my case, the URL is:
<http://lab1-git-race-app-env.eu-west-3.elasticbeanstalk.com>

If any modification is made to the repository, we must use the command `git push` to push the changes to the CodeCommit branch (if that doesn't work, we can use `eb deploy` to restart the Elastic Beanstalk environment with the update or manually upload the `.war` file on the path `build/libs` in the environment console).

### NOTE

- If any of the `eb` commands is not working, it is possible to use the command `python <python-scripts-folder>/eb-script.py` (replacing `<python-scripts-folder>` with the location where the python scripts are installed in your machine).

## Which is the purpose of a specific java annotation

<!-- omit in toc -->

### @SpringBootApplication

This annotation is used on top of most Spring Boot main class programs, as it enables the developer an to configure and scan for components automatically.

This annotation has teh same function as @ComponentScan, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @Configuration with their default attributes, allowing the developer to reduce this three annotations into only one.

Here's a brief description of each annotation's function:

- @Configuration: allows us define the class which possesses it as a configuration class. It also allows us to inject additional dependencies(beans).
- @EnableAutoConfiguration: it's Spring Boot's automatic configuration, which changes in function of the beans aggregated.
- @ComponentScan: works alongside @Configuration in order to tell Spring where to find other @Component, always on the package where the application is located.

If the developer wants to replace one of these three annotations for a different one, it would be necessary to substitute the unwanted annotation.

## How to get the required api keys

This application is using [The One API](https://the-one-api.dev/) therefore, an API key is required.
To get this key access to the website [The One API SIGN UP](https://the-one-api.dev/sign-up)
and create an account using a valid email. Once the account has been created you will
received a key.

Finally add the value of the key to the variable app.api_key in the application.properties
file.

## How to access to the LOTR feature

Access to the path /rings-quote to use this feature.
Remember to set the api key first to use it.

## How to access the password generator

The password generator is found in the path /password. You can easily find a link at the bottom of the welcome page.

## How works the password generator

When you access the password generator, you have to enter one or more words to generate a password. The words entered are encrypted using AES, which
is a symmetric encryption algorithm. The secret key used is the actual date with the next format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.

If none words are input, the password isn't generated. Otherwise, it shows the password and statistics about it:

- Number of characters (length)
- Number of special characters
- Number of uppercase letters
- Number of lowercase letters
- Number of digits

Source of AES encryption: <https://howtodoinjava.com/java/java-security/java-aes-encryption-example/>

## How to modify the password generated

Below the stadistics, you can modify the password specifying how many characters you want to add at random positions. These characters can be:

- special characters
- uppercase letters
- lowercase letters
- digits
- random characters

When a negative number is input, it is ignored.

## How to deploy Docker image on Google Cloud Kubernetes

With **Dockerfile** file, you can compile the application and run it in a Docker container.
In this case, the **Dockerfile** is divided in two parts:

- The first part compiles the code using **Gradle**. By default, Docker can´t acces to Gradle. The command `COPY --chown=gradle:gradle . __DIR__` allows Docker to use it. You can set the work directory of Docker by adding `WORKDIR __DIR__`. This parts execute `gradle build` command, which make all the test to check if it works.
- The second part copies the _war_ file generated by Docker to the selected path. Withouth copying the _war_ file, the following command would not work. With `ENTRYPOINT ["java"]` and `CMD ["-jar", "/app/lab1-git-race.war"]` you set the command that Docker will execute when you run it.

First, you must build Docker image by:
`docker build -t ingweb/git-race .`

Finally, run the Docker image with:

`docker run -i -p 8080:8080 ingweb/git-race`

It´s very important to declare the port. In this case, we use port 8080.
Now you can access to the service by searching (<http://localhost:8080>) on the browser.
If it doesn't works, check the created Docker container with:
`docker container ls`

Once created the Docker image, you can deploy the App into [Google Cloud Kubernetes](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine?hl=es) platform.
Follow these steps to deploy Docker containter on Kuberentes:

- Create a Google Cloud account with you educational mail (@unizar)
- Create a [proyect on Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)
- You can use [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) or work locally (need to install [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts))
- Install [Kubernetes command line](https://kubernetes.io/)
- Compile and name the Docker image
- Configure Docker command line tool to authenticate in [Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry)
- Push the Docker image to Container Registry
- Create a GKE cluster selecting the proyect id and [compute zone](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry)
- Create a Kubernetes implementation for the Docker image (with flag num-nodes=1)
- Set 3 replicas
- Create _HorizontalPodAutoscaler_ resource for implementation
- Generate Kubernetes service for the App implementation

## How to access the text word counter

The text word counter is found in the path /textCounter. You can find a link on the welcome page.

## WebClient, Reactive Web and how to use it to consume Twitter API key

### Introduction

In the traditional web, the logic is in the server side and clients fetch data synchronously from the server, usually the html because the webs have server-side rendering. In the reactive web, the logic is in the server side and in the client side. The client can fetch data asynchronously and modify the html with client side rendering [1](https://www.outsystems.com/blog/posts/all-you-need-to-know-about-reactive-web/).

The original web framework provided by [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/) is Spring Web MVC. However, as we have seen with the reactive web, there is a need for non-blocking constructs that enable handling concurrency using fewer hardware resources. The purpose of Spring Webflux is to create a new "API to serve as a foundation accross any non-blocking runtime".

### RestTemplate vs. WebClient

"Spring Web MVC offers `RestTemplate` as a web client abstraction. It uses the Java Servlet API based on the thread-per-request model. This means that the thread will block until the web client receives the response" [2](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-webclient-resttemplate). This is not optimal because if we make many requests, and some of them take a long time, the threads will stay block and ultimately it will exhaust the thread pool. Spring Webflux offers `WebClient` as an asynchronous non-blocking web client abstraction.

### Twitter functionality

The functionality added to the application in the endpoint `/twitter/{user}` prints the last 5 tweets of _user_. It does so by using `WebClient` to consume the Twitter API.

To replicate this functionality, you have to create a [Twitter Developper Account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access) and a Project. This will generate some credentials that you have to add to `src/main/java/resources/application.properties`. (This is not the best way to do it and Spring offers better alternatives like [Spring Vault](https://spring.io/projects/spring-vault)).

To be more precise, this functionality has been implemented with `WebClient` but the request is done in a synchronous way by explicitly blocking the request:

```java
String res = client.get()
                    .uri("?screen_name=" + user + "&count=5")
                    .header("authorization", "Bearer " + twitter_bearer)
                    .retrieve()
                    .bodyToMono(String.class)
                    .block();
```

## How to play space invaders

The movement area is restricted to the sides and the bottom by the limits of the page.
The spaceship can't move upwards past a certain limit.

- w - Move up
- A - Move left
- S - Move down
- D - Move right
- Space - Shoot

Keep pressed the different keys to perform the action continuously.

When the game ends, just refresh the navigator to start all over.

## How space invaders was implemented

This simpler web version of the space invaders was implemented on javascript using the html element canvas.

The canvas allows to render images into the screen, so we can print the different sprites that the game needs.
The sprites are implemented on a Sprite class that extends the Image class, and we need to set the source to be able to access them.
In this case, the sprites are stored in the "static/images/" folder, so the src code is "/images/image.extension" due to spring looking for the content in the static folder by default.
The sprites are created in their corresponding classes and stored in arrays so we can access them later.

Game loop is simple:

- First, we need to create all the elements we need.
- We need to render all the images, in this case, we have a render function that does this for us.
  In the render function, we loop over the different sprite arrays to render all of them.
- Finally, the loop function calls render and then modifies the elements(movement of the spaceship, bullets etc).The different events that occur in the game just change values that are set in the loop.

This loop is set with the setInterval(func, time(ms)), that calls the given function on the time interval we want.

Movement and shooting has been implemented on a simple event pattern, when a key is pressed, we set a flag to true, so that the loop knows the
key is pressed. When the key is not pressed anymore, the flag is set to false.
To know which key is pressed, we access the event.key field that stores the string that represents the key.

Animations are implemented using a frame counter, that way, we can control whether or not we want to render an image based on the frame we are on. Frames advance each time the loop is called.

## How to use buildPushRun.sh script

This bash script helps the programer to:

- Build containing folder with Gradle
- Push the docker image to Docker Hub ®
- Run the Docker container.

**Here is the script usage summary:**

- ./buildPushRun.sh -B        for BUILD
- ./buildPushRun.sh -P        for PUSH
- ./buildPushRun.sh -R        for RUN
- ./buildPushRun.sh -BR      for BUILD & RUN
- ./buildPushRun.sh -A        for BUILD, PUSH & RUN
- ./buildPushRun.sh             for HELP

As you can see you can choose to execute 3 options in a row, online one option (build, push or run), or if you prefer you can build and run without pushing.
In each option the script will ask for some data. For example the run and build option will require docker image name, and the push option will ask for your Docker Hub username and the repository final name.

## How to monitor with Grafana and Prometheus

This two softwares can be deployed with Helm inside a Kubernetes cluster. First of all, we need to have a K8s cluster running, for example we can deploy it on [Google](#how-to-deploy-Docker-image-on-Google-Cloud-Kubernetes) or if you want a simple and quick set-up Minikube is a good option.

**Minikube set-up steps:**

1. [Install minikube on the machine](#https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
2. Run `minikube start`. This will create a one node k8s cluster.
3. Execute `kubectl apply -f webpage.yaml`
   This file contains the necessary lines to run a pod with our webpage in the cluster. When we execute this command Kubectl pull the docker image that we specified in the file on line 32 and run it on a Pod. It's advisable to change the image kubernetes pull for the deploy (line 32).
4. [Install helm](#https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
5. Install prometheus with Helm: `helm install stable/prometheus-operator --generate-name`
6. Now if you execute kubectl get pods you can see multiple prometheus pods running in the cluster
7. Exposing the Prometheus and Grafana pod is as easy as edit the yaml. Execute `kubectl edit service prometheus-operator-XXXXXX-prometheus` and change in spec section _type:ClusterIP_ for _type:LoadBalancer_. For Grafana is the same process but the command is `kubectl edit svc prometheus-operator-XXXXXXXXXX-grafana`.
8. Now with `minikube service prometheus-service-name --url` you can get the exposed url
9. Once we are logged in Grafana _( defult user: admin_, _default password: prom-operator )_ we set Prometheus as the data source for our metrics and start to monitor.
10. Finally, we can create diferent dashboards monitoring several resources

## How the weather API works

The weather info is retrieved from the services of [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/) (you can request an API key for free).

This API gives us a lot of information about the weather around the world in different locations. For this project, the API is harcoded to request the weather in Zaragoza city, and we only take the current temperature, but this could be scaled to receive information for any city and take a lot more data such as humidity, wind, forecast information, etc in future versions.

You need to provide a valid API key in the file "application.properties". If you don't provide it, the API won't work and for making the future development of the code easier, the default value is "NO_KEY". This is because if the API key is not valid, it may cause a fatal exception and cause a 500 error code.

## How the coronavirus API works

The API used and its documentation can be found on the website https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc

The GET request https://api.covid19api.com/world/total is used
where the data is collected in an updated way: infected, deceased and recovered by the pandemic.

Every time the web is loaded from the root "/" address the data is loaded from the API.

## How Show my home! works
Mapping services are provided by [_Openstreetmap_](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). Also, [_Leaflet_](https://leafletjs.com/) is used for adding extra information and functionalities to map such as searching bar and popups. 

Instead of showing your actual home, initially, you will see EINA's location with a popup that says: "Home is where your Wifi connects automatically. Eduroam <3". Created with the aim of being a joke for us, engineers, who spend so much hours in there. After that, you can search whatever location you want to with the searching bar above.

For developping this service, we just have had to add scripts and stylesheet provided by [_Leaflet_](https://leafletjs.com/) and to add showLocation.js file in resources path for customizing the map (initial position, initial zoom, popup and information associated) and the components showed on it (searching bar and its format and its options).
